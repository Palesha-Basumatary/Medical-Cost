# Problem Statement 
This dataset is about the medical cost of an individual. This data science problem's domain is medical field and using those given datas in the datase, we try to find the medical cost. 


## Dataset

The dataset used is the [mushroom_dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) from Kaggle.

Since the medical cost is a continuous target variable, the task is a regression task.

**Target Variable: MedicalCost**
<br>
<br>
Medical Cost refers to the medical bill based on their health conditions
<br>
**Mean Medical Cost:** 13349.1037$
<br>
**Max Medical Cost:** 40373.9683$ 
<br>
**Min Medical Cost:** 18.2489$ 


## Model(s) Used

The models used for this task are Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression and Decision tree: 

**-Linear Regression** is a supervised machine learning model. It is used to find linear relationship between the predictors and target value. The model is trained to find a suitable linear line having a minimum mean squared error using the training data. 

**-Polynomial Regression** is a supervised machine learnig model. It is used to find nth degree polynomial relationship between the dependent and independent values. The model is trained using the training data to fit the polynomial function having the least mean squared error.

**-Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning model. The Decision tree works by spliting the data into nested categories.
